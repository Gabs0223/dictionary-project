This is a dictionary where you can find the pronuntiation, all definitions and several images from a requested word ðŸ‘€ðŸ”ŽðŸ“–

For this app I used:
* React
* The dictionary API from https://dictionaryapi.dev/ 
* The Pexels API https://www.pexels.com/es-es/api/
* Netlify to host the web app

You can find the app and search for words here https://gabs-dictionary.netlify.app/

Have fun! ðŸŒ
